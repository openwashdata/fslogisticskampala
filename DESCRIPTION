Description: 
    This package contains two data resources. `trips` contains the GPS locations 
    of faecal sludge emptying trucks collecting sludge from pit latrines and 
    septic tanks in Kampala, Uganda. Each trip is recorded with a unique 
    identifier, the numberplate of the truck, the date and  time of the record. 
    Data was collected from 30th March 2015 until 25th June 2015. `trucks` has
    additional information on the volume of each truck.
